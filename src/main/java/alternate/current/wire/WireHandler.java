/**
 * This class handles power changes for redstone wire. The algorithm was
 * designed with the following goals in mind:
 * <br>
 * 1. Minimize the number of times a wire checks its surroundings to determine
 * its power level.
 * <br>
 * 2. Minimize the number of block and shape updates emitted.
 * <br>
 * 3. Emit block and shape updates in a deterministic, non-locational order,
 * fixing bug MC-11193.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In Vanilla redstone wire is laggy because it fails on points 1 and 2.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Redstone wire updates recursively and each wire calculates its power level in
 * isolation rather than in the context of the network it is a part of. This
 * means a wire in a grid can change its power level over half a dozen times
 * before settling on its final value. This problem used to be worse in 1.13 and
 * below, where a wire would only decrease its power level by 1 at a time.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In addition to this, a wire emits 42 block updates and up to 22 shape updates
 * each time it changes its power level.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Of those 42 block updates, 6 are to itself, which are thus not only
 * redundant, but a big source of lag, since those cause the wire to
 * unnecessarily re-calculate its power level. A block only has 24 neighbors
 * within a Manhattan distance of 2, meaning 12 of the remaining 36 block
 * updates are duplicates and thus also redundant.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Of the 22 shape updates, only 6 are strictly necessary. The other 16 are sent
 * to blocks diagonally above and below. These are necessary if a wire changes
 * its connections, but not when it changes its power level.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Redstone wire in Vanilla also fails on point 3, though this is more of a
 * quality-of-life issue than a lag issue. The recursive nature in which it
 * updates, combined with the location-dependent order in which each wire
 * updates its neighbors, makes the order in which neighbors of a wire network
 * are updated incredibly inconsistent and seemingly random.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Alternate Current fixes each of these problems as follows.
 * 
 * <p>
 * 1. To make sure a wire calculates its power level as little as possible, we
 * remove the recursive nature in which redstone wire updates in Vanilla.
 * Instead, we build a network of connected wires, find those wires that receive
 * redstone power from "outside" the network, and spread the power from there.
 * This has a few advantages:
 * <br>
 * - Each wire checks for power from non-wire components at most once, and from
 * nearby wires just twice.
 * <br>
 * - Each wire only sets its power level in the world once. This is important,
 * because calls to Level.setBlock are even more expensive than calls to
 * Level.getBlockState.
 * 
 * <p>
 * 2. There are 2 obvious ways in which we can reduce the number of block and
 * shape updates.
 * <br>
 * - Get rid of the 18 redundant block updates and 16 redundant shape updates,
 * so each wire only emits 24 block updates and 6 shape updates whenever it
 * changes its power level.
 * <br>
 * - Only emit block updates and shape updates once a wire reaches its final
 * power level, rather than at each intermediary stage.
 * <br>
 * For an individual wire, these two optimizations are the best you can do, but
 * for an entire grid, you can do better!
 * 
 * <p>
 * Since we calculate the power of the entire network, sending block and shape
 * updates to the wires in it is redundant. Removing those updates can reduce
 * the number of block and shape updates by up to 20%.
 * 
 * <p>
 * 3. To make the order of block updates to neighbors of a network
 * deterministic, the first thing we must do is to replace the location-
 * dependent order in which a wire updates its neighbors. Instead, we base it on
 * the direction of power flow. This part of the algorithm was heavily inspired
 * by theosib's 'RedstoneWireTurbo', which you can read more about in theosib's
 * comment on Mojira <a href="https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-81098?focusedCommentId=420777&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-420777">here</a>
 * or by checking out its implementation in carpet mod <a href="https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/blob/master/src/main/java/carpet/helpers/RedstoneWireTurbo.java">here</a>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The idea is to determine the direction of power flow through a wire based on
 * the power it receives from neighboring wires. For example, if the only power
 * a wire receives is from a neighboring wire to its west, it can be said that
 * the direction of power flow through the wire is east.
 * 
 * <p>
 * We make the order of block updates to neighbors of a wire depend on what is
 * determined to be the direction of power flow. This not only removes
 * locationality entirely, it even removes directionality in a large number of
 * cases. Unlike in 'RedstoneWireTurbo', however, I have decided to keep a
 * directional element in ambiguous cases, rather than to introduce randomness,
 * though this is trivial to change.
 * 
 * <p>
 * While this change fixes the block update order of individual wires, we must
 * still address the overall block update order of a network. This turns out to
 * be a simple fix, because of a change we made earlier: we search through the
 * network for wires that receive power from outside it, and spread the power
 * from there. If we make each wire transmit its power to neighboring wires in
 * an order dependent on the direction of power flow, we end up with a
 * non-locational and largely non-directional wire update order.
